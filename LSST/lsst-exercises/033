The escape sequence \033 (also represented as \e or \x1B) is the ASCII escape character in octal notation. 
It is used as a starting point for many terminal control sequences that allow you to manipulate the display and 
formatting of text in the terminal. 
These control sequences are typically used with the echo -e command in bash or other programming languages that support escape sequences.

Here's a table of some common escape sequences (also known as ANSI escape codes) and their applications for text formatting 
and display in the terminal:
